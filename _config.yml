description: I have always been driven by a passion for problem-solving and finding efficient solutions. With a strong aptitude for math and related subjects, I initially pursued medicine, drawn to its logical framework. My ability to learn quickly, make connections, and find clarity helped me excel in my studies. Research was particularly rewarding, as I enjoyed the process of making predictions, conducting calculations, and analyzing the outcomes. While I ultimately realized medicine wasn't my ideal career path, my medical training instilled valuable skills: meticulousness, the ability to act decisively under pressure, teamwork, and compassionate interpersonal interactions.
