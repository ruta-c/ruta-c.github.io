## About Me:
- I have always been passionate about solving problems and finding the easiest ways to do so.
- Even though I loved and excelled in mathematics and related subjects like physics and chemistry, I chose a career in medicine, believing it to be full of logic.
- Studying medicine was not difficult for me, as I quickly learned by efficiently making connections. When I couldn't, I created methods that made sense to me.
- During various research projects, I found joy in making predictions, performing calculations, and observing the outcomes, whether surprising or not.
- Although I later realized that medicine was not the best fit for me, I am grateful for the lessons it taught me: to be meticulous, to act quickly in stressful situations, to work in a team, and to deal with all kinds of people with kindness and patience.
