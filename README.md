## Projects
### Aruodas Real Estate Price Prediction ML Model
[Can be found here]([https://github.com/ruta-c/Aruodas-Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-ML-Model])

This project entails the extraction of data from real estate advertisements on the web page aruodas.lt, followed by data preparation and the development of a machine learning model for price prediction. The primary objective of this endeavor is exclusively educational, aimed at fostering a deeper understanding of data extraction, preparation, and predictive modeling within the context of real estate pricing.

Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
